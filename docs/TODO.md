# TODO

## Boilerplate Cleanup

- [x] **Page title** — `src/routes/__root.tsx:27` still reads `"TanStack Start Starter"`. Update to `"bill chill"`.

## UI / UX

- [x] **Router-driven loading refactor** — bundle the global progress bar with a sweep to move per-route data fetching into TanStack Router loaders (`queryClient.ensureQueryData`). Single source of truth for "navigating": fake indeterminate bar, 200ms delay before showing, tied to `useRouterState({ select: s => s.status })`. With loaders pre-warming the cache, every `if (isLoading) return "Loading..."` block on a loader-backed route becomes dead code and should be removed in the same pass. Empty states and mutation `isPending` blocks stay as-is — `isLoading` is `isPending && !hasData` so it only fires on truly uncached queries, which loaders eliminate.
- [ ] **Mobile table pass** — bills/index, bills/archived, schedules/archived tables get cut off below `md`. Switch to stacked card rows at `<md` (table at `md+`).

## Backend / Infra

- [ ] **Clerk `user.deleted` webhook** — when a Clerk account is deleted, cascade-delete all rows scoped to that `userId` in `bills`, `pay_schedules`, `bill_instances`. Otherwise data is orphaned and the user has no path to remove it (GDPR-adjacent concern). Webhook endpoint should verify the Svix signature using `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then run a single transaction (or sequential deletes — bill_instances has FK to bills with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so deleting bills + pay_schedules should suffice; verify schema).

## Features to Build

- [x] Server functions + React Query hooks for bill domain (pay schedules, bills, bill instances)
  - **Bills** — list/detail/archived CRUD + query hooks done ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts), [bills-model.ts](src/features/bills/bills-model.ts))
  - **Pay schedules** — full CRUD done ([pay-schedules-model.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-model.ts), [pay-schedules-service.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-service.ts), [pay-schedules-queries.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-queries.ts))
  - **Bill instances** — full implementation done ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts))
    - [x] `bills-helpers.ts` — `clampDayToMonth`, `computeNearestUnpaidDueDate`, `deriveBillState`
    - [x] `recordBillPayment`, `updateBillInstance`, `deleteBillInstance`, `listCurrentMonthInstances` server functions
    - [x] `useRecordBillPayment`, `useUpdateBillInstance`, `useDeleteBillInstance`, `useCurrentMonthInstances` hooks
  - [x] **State derivation** — `deriveBillState(bill, instances, today)` in `bills-helpers.ts` returning the `PAID | OVERDUE | MISSED_SCHEDULE | UPCOMING` union from CLAUDE.md (frontend-only, O(1) Map lookup keyed on `billId`)
- [x] **Responsive drawer/sheet component** — [responsive-drawer.tsx](src/components/ui/responsive-drawer.tsx)
- [x] **Backend gaps** — `logHistoricalPayment` + `deleteBill` server functions and hooks ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts))
- [x] **Bill management page** — [bills/index.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/index.tsx)
- [x] **Bill detail page** — [bills/$billId.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/$billId.tsx)
- [x] **Bills archive page** — [bills/archived.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/archived.tsx)
- [ ] Dashboard page (JIT state derivation, 3-row hierarchy)
- [ ] create bill - "add another" check box
- [ ] create bill - consider including more fields in the "quick add" ui
- [ ] "anchor" day/date rename in ui since it might feel unclear for users.
- [ ] related to above: could probably include some helper text across the app
