# TODO

## Boilerplate Cleanup

- [x] **Page title** — `src/routes/__root.tsx:27` still reads `"TanStack Start Starter"`. Update to `"bill chill"`.

## UI / UX

- [x] **Router-driven loading refactor** — bundle the global progress bar with a sweep to move per-route data fetching into TanStack Router loaders (`queryClient.ensureQueryData`). Single source of truth for "navigating": fake indeterminate bar, 200ms delay before showing, tied to `useRouterState({ select: s => s.status })`. With loaders pre-warming the cache, every `if (isLoading) return "Loading..."` block on a loader-backed route becomes dead code and should be removed in the same pass. Empty states and mutation `isPending` blocks stay as-is — `isLoading` is `isPending && !hasData` so it only fires on truly uncached queries, which loaders eliminate.
- [x] **Mobile table pass** — bills/index, bills/archived, schedules/archived tables get cut off below `md`. Switch to stacked card rows at `<md` (table at `md+`).

## Backend / Infra

- [ ] **Clerk `user.deleted` webhook** — when a Clerk account is deleted, cascade-delete all rows scoped to that `userId` in `bills`, `pay_schedules`, `bill_instances`. Otherwise data is orphaned and the user has no path to remove it (GDPR-adjacent concern). Webhook endpoint should verify the Svix signature using `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then run a single transaction (or sequential deletes — bill_instances has FK to bills with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so deleting bills + pay_schedules should suffice; verify schema).

## Features to Build

- [x] Server functions + React Query hooks for bill domain (pay schedules, bills, bill instances)
  - **Bills** — list/detail/archived CRUD + query hooks done ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts), [bills-model.ts](src/features/bills/bills-model.ts))
  - **Pay schedules** — full CRUD done ([pay-schedules-model.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-model.ts), [pay-schedules-service.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-service.ts), [pay-schedules-queries.ts](src/features/pay-schedules/pay-schedules-queries.ts))
  - **Bill instances** — full implementation done ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts))
    - [x] `bills-helpers.ts` — `clampDayToMonth`, `computeNearestUnpaidDueDate`, `deriveBillState`
    - [x] `recordBillPayment`, `updateBillInstance`, `deleteBillInstance`, `listCurrentMonthInstances` server functions
    - [x] `useRecordBillPayment`, `useUpdateBillInstance`, `useDeleteBillInstance`, `useCurrentMonthInstances` hooks
  - [x] **State derivation** — `deriveBillState(bill, instances, today)` in `bills-helpers.ts` returning the `PAID | OVERDUE | MISSED_SCHEDULE | UPCOMING` union from CLAUDE.md (frontend-only, O(1) Map lookup keyed on `billId`)
- [x] **Responsive drawer/sheet component** — [responsive-drawer.tsx](src/components/ui/responsive-drawer.tsx)
- [x] **Backend gaps** — `logHistoricalPayment` + `deleteBill` server functions and hooks ([bills-service.ts](src/features/bills/bills-service.ts), [bills-queries.ts](src/features/bills/bills-queries.ts))
- [x] **Bill management page** — [bills/index.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/index.tsx)
- [x] **Bill detail page** — [bills/$billId.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/$billId.tsx)
- [x] **Bills archive page** — [bills/archived.tsx](src/routes/_authenticated/bills/archived.tsx)
- [x] Dashboard page (JIT state derivation, 3-row hierarchy)
- [ ] Dashboard — small celebratory donut animation on payment (snapshot widgets in Row 2 animate the fill increment when a `bill_instance` is recorded)
- [ ] Bill Actions drawer — empty state illustration (drawer reads `"You're all caught up."` when both sections are empty; design something simple to reinforce the moment)
- [ ] Bill Actions nav button — pick the icon and define the active/inactive treatment (currently spec'd as "outlined → filled with peach background" but the icon itself is TBD; needs a design pass before build)
- [ ] create bill - "add another" check box
- [ ] create bill - consider including more fields in the "quick add" ui
- [ ] "anchor" day/date rename in ui since it might feel unclear for users.
- [ ] related to above: could probably include some helper text across the app
- [ ] replace one-off svgs with react-icons (feather)
- [ ] **Dashboard updates**
  - [x] **User-switch cache flash** — sign out + sign in as a different user briefly flashed the previous user's cached data. Fixed via `AuthCacheWatcher` in `__root.tsx` that clears the query cache when Clerk's `userId` changes.
  - [ ] **Stale state after login (deferred — couldn't repro)** — dashboard occasionally rendered "no active schedule" on first load post-sign-in; refresh fixed it. Keep an eye on it; suspected cause is SSR/auth-cookie timing landing `[]` in the cache with `staleTime: 5min` preventing a refetch.
  - [ ] **Brief flash on first dashboard load** — empty/loading state visible briefly before data arrives. Probably client-side navigation post-sign-in skipping SSR; deferred until easier to repro.
  - [x] **Auto-pay icon swap** — current teal checkmark conflicts visually with the paid-state checkbox indicator. Replace with something that reads "recurring/automatic" (e.g. `FiRepeat` or `FiRefreshCw`).
  - [x] **Row 4 — keep paid bills visible** — broaden the filter to include this-month bills with `dueDayOfMonth >= today` regardless of state. Paid rows render muted/strikethrough with a compact "Paid" badge in the Pay button slot. Cap stays at 7. Reasoning: paid items disappearing entirely loses the "what's already taken care of" at-a-glance value.
  - [x] **Row 3 — drop the checkbox** — read-only on the dashboard (corrections go through detail), so it doesn't earn its real estate. Use the right-side action slot for Pay button when actionable, compact "Paid" badge when paid.
  - [x] **Row 3 — sort by paid status** — sort key becomes `isPaid asc, dueDayOfMonth asc`. Paid at bottom so the top of the list is always the next thing to act on.
- [ ] reevaluate the error/warning color. right now i thhink the color is a little too comforting to stand out as an error color. but we also want whatever error color we choose to still fit the palette.
- [ ] global not found / 404 page
- [ ] archived (bill/schedule) page: archived column, use locale number date string rather than spelled out eg 6/15/26 vs june 15 2026.
